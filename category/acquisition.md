## Data

The data we use for this project is taken from the Dunnhumby data science company.
Inside we find a two years long study over 2500 households who are frequent shoppers
at a specific retailer brand. In the dataset we can also find interesting information
about the household demographic and marketing contact history.

This dataset was initially proposed for academic research to study the effect of
direct marketing to customers. But we, as a group, were interested in repurposing
the dataset for social good.
