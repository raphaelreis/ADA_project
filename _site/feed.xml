&lt;p&gt;The Dunnhumby company process and analyses tonnes of data to improve data-driven businesses knowledge. However, us as group we were not intserested in market targeting but in how using such datasets for &lt;strong&gt;social good&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all that transaction-related informations and advanced web scrapping tools, we were able to build a nice prototype which associate calories and nutriments composition to most of sold food product. This technology open a new way of questioning the data to cluster household based on food/drink consumption which was not possible with the default dataset only. This way, we expected finding out meaningful difference between the poorest and richest households consumption habits, between old and young people, etc…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the dataset is far much richer than food related products. Indeed, we can find huge amount of purchases of daily life such as gasoline (oil) transactions and natality products. Thus, in a second step we enlarged our analysis to detect categories of household based on their overall purchases. We expected that people consumption would demonstrate tendencies related to healthy vs. unhealthy life styles.&lt;/p&gt;
